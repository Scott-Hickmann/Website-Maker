Create an app capable of analyzing field incident reports. First you upload multiple documents. Then, the app creates a consolidated timeline table with: time, crew, key action, customers affected, equipment, along with a dashboard of insights, and a graph of customers affected over time. Use Claude 4.5 (model name is claude-sonnet-4-5) within the application to read the documents and extract that data using this API key: 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. Add an export button to download the table as html.
